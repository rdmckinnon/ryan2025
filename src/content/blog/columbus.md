Mary Black’s “Columbus” sounds like a deep breath before a big move. I loop it whenever I’m sorting travel photos—the song holds that mix of fear and excitement you feel before stepping onto a plane or boat with no plan beyond “let’s go.”

The arrangement is spare enough that her voice carries the whole story. It gives me room to think about what went right on the trip and what I’ll do differently next time.
