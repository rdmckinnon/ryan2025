When the day doesn’t go to plan, this duet helps reset the tone. The arrangement is huge but somehow still intimate—perfect for those evenings when the edit queue is long and patience is short.

Oleta Adams’ vocal run around the three-minute mark never fails to straighten my posture and remind me to keep moving.
