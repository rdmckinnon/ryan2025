I put this on when I’m culling family photos after everyone crashes. The slow build matches the rhythm of whittling hundreds of frames down to a handful—it starts gentle, swells right when you need a second wind, and ends with enough hope to keep going.

The song never fails to pull me back to why I shoot in the first place: to document the messy parts and the grace in between.
