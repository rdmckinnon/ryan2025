If we’re rolling before dawn, “The Chain” is the first song through the speakers. The tension in that bass line snaps everyone awake and sets the tempo for the whole shoot. I’ve lost track of how many sunrise timelapses start with that break.

It’s the perfect reminder to stay glued together when plans change mid-trip—no matter how loud the wind gets, you hold on.
