This one is reserved for night drives back from the west coast when everyone else is dozing. The slow build matches the shimmer of headlights on water, and Bono’s chorus gives just enough lift to keep me alert.

It’s the anthem for wide-open places and a reminder that the best locations usually sit past whatever road signs we recognize.
