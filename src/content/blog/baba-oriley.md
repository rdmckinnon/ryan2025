The Who’s opener from *Who’s Next* is still my go‑to when we’re chasing first light up the coast. That bubbling synth loop feels like a countdown to whatever the day throws at us, and the violin breakdown always makes the kids laugh. I keep hitting repeat until the coffee kicks in.

It’s a reliable reminder that the “wasteland” only wins if you stay parked. Windows down, salt in the air, camera bag in the backseat—hit play and roll.
