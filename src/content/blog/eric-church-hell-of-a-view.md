When we’re hauling kids, gear, and coolers up A1A, this is the song that steadies the mood. Church sings like he’s talking directly from the passenger seat—grateful for the chaos, aware the ride doesn’t always follow the map.

It’s a good reset button after the inevitable wrong turn: windows down, volume up, keep cruising. That line about “worth the trouble” hits every time.
